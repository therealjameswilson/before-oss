# Accessibility and responsive QA

Run: 2026-07-29 UTC

## Result

**PASS - 48 / 48 browser cases.**

The production static build was tested with Playwright 1.62.0 and axe-core
4.12.1 at desktop, phone, and tablet viewport profiles.

Routes tested at all three sizes:

- home;
- personnel directory after its 23,941-row search index loaded;
- a direct person profile;
- organizations;
- analysis;
- methodology;
- sources;
- downloads.

Assertions covered semantic headings, direct-route responses, search and
commissioned-status filtering, shareable query parameters, source-row display,
serial-number masking, public-download availability, and serious/critical WCAG
2 A/AA and 2.1 A/AA axe rules. The twelve researched-profile cases verify that
reviewed claims expose citation metadata, that the confirmed McWilliams profile
keeps the immediate federal assignment distinct from the last civilian
employer, and that the reviewed Bunche, Casey, Goldberg, and Hayden profiles
preserve their distinct pre-OSS pathways at desktop, phone, and tablet sizes.
They also verify the distinct military, government, and civilian pathways
documented for Morris Berg, Virginia Hall, Richard M. Helms, and William E.
Colby, including the explicit unresolved wording where no reviewed civilian
employer claim exists.

The first run found a contrast failure in the dark-section definition cards.
The cards were changed to an opaque paper background with dark text and the
complete suite was rerun. Final result: zero serious or critical axe violations
on the tested routes and viewports.

The in-app browser review also confirmed the phone homepage and personnel
directory layouts visually and found no browser console errors.
