## Internal static routes

**PASS.** The production build contains 24,159 HTML files. Every relative
`href` and `src` target resolves under the GitHub Pages base path
`/before-oss/`.

The build includes 23,941 person profiles, 210 organization profiles, and the
home, directory, organizations, analysis, methodology, sources, downloads, and
404 pages.

The checker inventoried 48,360 unique external URLs for separate live
verification; external responses do not affect the internal-route pass.

and GitHub Pages deployment

for terminal protocols and Allied pathways Batch 045 release `203d43b`
completed
successfully.

Live checks returned HTTP 200 and the expected content marker, data value, row
count, or redaction state for all 17
tested targets:

- the home page;
- Billie F. Akin, Étienne Ancergues, Julia N. Barnhart, Philip H. Chadbourn
  Jr., Jacqueline M. Landry, Gus Macriyanni, Carl D. Marshall, Constantine
  Papadopoulos, and Lawrence N. Stevens;
- `data/stats.json`;
- all four public CSV downloads;
- the public personnel JSONL download; and
- the sources-page NARA attribution notice and full-service-number redaction on
  the nine reviewed profiles.

The live statistics report 23,978 source rows, 23,941 person entities, 289
people with non-planned research attempts, 178 verified-affiliation people, 106
verified-employer people, 226 archival-review assessments, 590 published
claims, and 482 public source records. The live personnel, organizations,
affiliations, and sources downloads contain 23,941, 212, 354, and 482 data rows
respectively. The live personnel CSV header contains `serial_masked` and no
full service-number field.

External link results are diagnostic and are not allowed to transform a source
access problem into a historical no-result conclusion.
